can you analize this current code and give me 2 improvements for it? 
and to be more specific i don't want to change anything in the code just write 
me the ideas here in chat AND make sure the ideas are specific for each function. 
like for example an improvement for the sessionlogger class and another one for the extraer 
palabras function.

-- 2:
okei so i like the sessionlogger idea but for the extraer palabras function can 
you maybe come up with some other idea? i am asking as i would like the idea to be 
more visible and impactful for the current code as it is because i would then need to 
make a google docs to explain the changes and why i did them

-- 3:
okei then, i now want you to take the sessionlogger idea and this new palabras clave idea and 
implement them in the code BUT not this file, it needs to be a new file called 
bloque_mejoras_MariusDanieBaroana.py because i need to have for my class a before and after chances 
files ya know. also make sure alongside the docsting files and comments that explain the functions 
and what's in them you mention what are the new 2 improvements we made

-- 4:
finally, i want you to elaborate more the docstrings in the functions
