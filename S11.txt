can you make a simple function that logs the results you get and it's like one file per 
session running and it has a easy to read and nice to read look in the log file?

--2
now that you made this i want you to add comments explaining stuff in the new code 
you added so a new beginner can understand and also make it so if the logs folder doesn't exist it gets 
automatically created
